# Ideas to Possibly Incorporate

## Coding Notes

- Make particles work without using the ship offset in Draw()

## General

### Loadout

Ships have 4 slots:
- Primary weapon
- Secondary weapon
- Two slots for any of the miscellaneous items

### Systems

- Ships have a power source which recharges weapons/shields/items at a certain rate
- Shields recharge, but once they're gone, they're gone

## Inventory

### Primary Weapon

- Laser: Better against shields
- Cannon: Better against hull
- Homing Cannon: Weaker than normal, but will home in (less aggressively than missiles)

### Secondary Weapon

- Homing Missile: Ronseal
- EMP: Disable nearby ships for a period
- Mine: Can be left lying around, will exist until something hits it

### Miscellaneous Items

- Chaff: Distracts homing missiles
- Jump: Transport to a safe place in the map (slow recharge?)
- Reactor: Systems charge faster
